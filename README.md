Usage of haarcascade to recognize a particular face from a data set

Given a large amount of data set of images, an algorithm is developed with the use of haarcascade to detect a particular face. The algorithm also further blurs the other detected faces which are not supposed to be detected but only focuses on the face which is supposed to be detected.
